# Lol

A useless website: [lol.loickpiera.com](https://lol.loickpiera.com) (previously hosted on multi.lol)

It features a canvas where hundred, thousand and more, "LOL" are drawn in a great ambiance :)

More seriously, this project allowed me to discover the HTML5 canvas some years ago.
It also provides a complete functional fallback for older browser (IE8 and below, I see you).
This fallback is based on DOM elements and is obviously slower than canvas.
